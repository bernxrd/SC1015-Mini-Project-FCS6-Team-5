# SC1015-Mini_Project

## About


## 1. Problem Formulation
- Dataset we used:
- Outcome of our project:
     - Are we able to predict GPU performance (FP32) based on its attributes
     - We can predict GPU performance based on factors like memory configuration, SM count, transistors count and die size
     - Predictive modeling of future generations and comparisions of future generational gaps between manufacturers 
     - Can modify the factors to improve the GPU performance
     - explore relationship between process node and transistor density
     - anaylsis of generational improvement of GPU performance 
- Motivation:
     - As cost of production of chips increases, we have to
