# SC1015-Mini_Project

## About


## 1. Problem Formulation
- Dataset we used:
- Outcome of our project:
     - Identify important attributes that correlate strongly to output performance (GFLOPS)
     - Modify the factors to improve the GPU performance
       
- Motivation:
     - As technology of manufacturing of chips advances, we cannot improve all aspects of chip manufacturing, so we suggest to focus on attributes that are very strongly correlated to output performance.

## 2. Data Preparation and Cleaning

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Multi-Variate data analysis: 
GPU clock, Memory clock, Transistors count



## 4. Machine Learning

Models Used:

## 5. Conclusion 
-  Data Driven Insights
-  Model Comparison
-  What did we learn


Generational performance 

Compare generational gaps 

Compare the performance progress of the two companies over the years 

Compare transistor density 

Predictive modeling of future GPU generations 

Predict Nvidia or AMD is doing better
